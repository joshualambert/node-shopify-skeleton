#Node-Shopify-Skeleton

##What is this ?
My base project to start out with for any node/express/shopify API.

##What you get

##Notes
* controllers/shopify.js
	- finalize: redirects to /welcome after final step of authentication. You can modify finalize to do whatever you need to do after successfully authenticating.
